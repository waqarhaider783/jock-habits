    <h2>Nike KD 14 Performance Review</h2>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The KD 14’s traction has been amazing if I contrast it to Nike Air Zoom GT
      Cut although cushion covering in Air Zoom GT Cut was on next level of ease
      with three layers. The shoe performed extremely well outdoors as well as
      indoors. They are my go-to shoe, at least until I get my new Puma Clyde
      All Pro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although they may not have the same bite as the Air Jordan 1, Nike Kobe 9,
      and Air Jordan XX8 models, the KD 14 is just as reliable as the other
      models.
